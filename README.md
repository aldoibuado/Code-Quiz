# Code-Quiz

## Description

My motivation for building this coding quiz app was to test out the skills I have learned so far and put it into practice! Practice makes perfect. Repetition is a good thing so having a game that is a quiz application with questions can help with memorizing. JavaScript is the logic of the webpage and it is interesting to see how it functions. A coding quiz game is a fun way to learn some new information. I learned how to add a timer to application and build logic for toggling to sections in the html. I still have a lot to learn, but it is fun to build things and test out skills.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You will be able to click on the start quiz button that will lead to the questions. There is also a timer and a high score.
